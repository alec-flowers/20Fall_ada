# Project - Report

The report can take two very different forms:

**A 3-page, double-column PDF report** (3 pages excluding references; written in LaTeX), following a standard structure (where applicable): abstract, introduction, related work, (brief) data collection, dataset description with summary statistics, methods with math and description of main algorithms, results and findings, conclusions. This report will be evaluated according to how clearly and succinctly it is written, if the style is appropriate (incl. proper figures etc.), if it contains all relevant contents, and how convincing the results of the analysis are.


**A data story**: Data stories take the form of a blog post or short article, with an important visual component, using data to tell a story and illustrate it effectively. You can be less formal here (although methods and math should then appear in the notebook), but more visual. You can pick your preferred platform option, but we encourage you to use Jekyll. You can either submit the story in an appropriate standalone format, or a link to it online. 

---
In both cases, a (single!) supporting notebook is also expected and will be graded. The README of the P3 milestone shall be updated detailing the contributions of all group members.

Example
John: Plotting graphs during data analysis, crawling the data, preliminary data analysis;
Mary: Problem formulation, coming up with the algorithm;
Chris: Coding up the algorithm, running tests, tabulating final results;
Eve: Writing up the report or the data story, preparing the final presentation.
